# THE ULTIMATE CODING QUIZ

While we have had a few assignments to create things from scratch, I'm gonna be the first to admit that JavaScript is not my strong suit. I did my best to break everything into smaller parts that I could tackle one by one. Instead of tearing my hair out with each, though, I thought it would be best to try and dissect code on the internet that was close to what I wanted, try to understand it, and adjust it to suit the purposes of the assignment.

What I got wasn't perfect, not by a long shot. But it hits a lot of the beats that we needed. I did leave the template CSS as I found it, since I figured that's not really what's important here. I wanted to put all my time and effort into the JavaScript and, to a lesser extent, the HTML.

I hope I did okay!

This was the criteria I was given to work with:

**AS A coding boot camp student**
**I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores**
**SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers**

**GIVEN I am taking a code quiz**
**WHEN I click the start button**
**THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question**
**WHEN I answer a question**
**THEN I am presented with another question**
**WHEN I answer a question incorrectly**
**THEN time is subtracted from the clock**
**WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0**
**THEN the game is over**
**WHEN the game is over**
**THEN I can save my initials and score**
